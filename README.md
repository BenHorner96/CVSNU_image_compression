## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to research and understand the approaches to and underlying theory behind modern compression techniques. Subsequently, to understand the differences in these techniques by implementation, experimentation, and evaluation.

## Approach
Our initial approach will be to attempt develop our own image compression format as a way to understand the problems in the topic first hand. After evaluating this process and any results obtained, we will then proceed to research around the most prominently used compression formats (such as jpeg and png) to discover how these formats tackled the problems that we faced. 
We will then attempt to evaluate the practical implications and trade-offs that these commonly used formats offer. With this new knowledge in hand, we will return to our initial algorithm and either improve upon what we created or implement one of the more common formats.

## Goals
Firstly and most obviously, obtain knowledge and expertise around the topic of image compression.
Secondly and more importantly, obtain first-hand experience in tackling problems faced in modern computer science and learn from the efforts of previous work.

## Potential Datasets for experimentation
For this project, we will use a variety of different images to experiment what type of images are easier to compress and what type of images cannot be compressed as well.

## Extension
If the main part of the project goes sufficiently to plan and in good time, the natural extension would be to perform the same process for video compression techniques.
